**L3xBOT: Empowering Vision Through Technology**

*L3xBOT* is an assistive technology tool designed to empower individuals who are blind or have low vision. Developed by Naomi McQuade, L3xBOT leverages computer vision, AI-driven guidance, and haptic feedback to make perception more accessible.

#### ✨ Features
- 🏷 **Object Recognition** — Real-time detection and identification using YOLOv3 and OpenCV.
- 🔊 **Speech Output** — Converts visual information into audio using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- 📳 **Haptic Feedback** — Vibrates to signal nearby obstacles, assisting navigation through touch.
- 🌍 **Accessible UX** — Built with simplicity and inclusivity at its core, ensuring ease of use for all.

#### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** – AI logic and core functionality  
- **OpenCV** – Image capture and processing  
- **YOLOv3** – Deep learning-based object detection  
- **Google TTS** – Voice response generation
