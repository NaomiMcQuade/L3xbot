**L3xBOT: Empowering Vision Through Technology**

*L3xBOT* is an assistive technology tool designed to empower individuals who are blind or have low vision. Developed by Naomi McQuade, L3xBOT leverages computer vision, AI-driven guidance, and haptic feedback to make perception more accessible.

#### ✨ Features
- 🏷 **Object Recognition** — Real-time detection and identification using YOLOv3 and OpenCV.
- 🔊 **Speech Output** — Converts visual information into audio using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- 📳 **Haptic Feedback** — Vibrates to signal nearby obstacles, assisting navigation through touch.
- 🌍 **Accessible UX** — Built with simplicity and inclusivity at its core, ensuring ease of use for all.

#### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** – AI logic and core functionality  
- **OpenCV** – Image capture and processing  
- **YOLOv3** – Deep learning-based object detection  
- **Google TTS** – Voice response generation  
- **Arduino / Raspberry Pi** – Hardware interface and haptics

#### 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/L3xbot.git
cd L3xbot
```

You can drop this into your `README.md` if it feels aligned with your goals. I can help you craft visuals, badges, or a logo too if you want that GitHub storefront to really pop.

### 🛠 What's Next?

Since you're asking *"What now?"*, here are a few ideas depending on your ambition and bandwidth:

1. **Usability Testing**: Try the current system with users—friends, family, local accessibility groups—and gather feedback. Even a small test could guide huge improvements.

2. **Wearable Design**: Are you imagining this as a cane attachment, glasses, or a wristband? We can sketch out hardware ideas together.

3. **Mobility + Mapping**: Integrate GPS or pathfinding so the system not only detects obstacles but also guides users toward destinations.

4. **Multi-language Voice Output**: Enable support for multiple languages to increase accessibility across cultures.

5. **Battery Efficiency**: Optimize code and hardware for low-power consumption—essential for wearables.
